## Task 1: Blog Website

### Incredibles of the Universe
  For this task, I have created a website titled "Incredibles of the Universe." This blog focuses on exploring the mysteries and wonders of the universe, delving into topics like the Big Bang theory, black holes, stars, galaxies, and the evolution of the cosmos.

### Website Structure
The blog website is structured as follows:
- **Home:** Overview and navigation links to other sections.
- **Big Bang Theory:** Detailed information about the origin of the universe.
- **Black Hole:** Exploration of the enigmatic cosmic entities.
- **Stars and Galaxies:** Insights into celestial bodies and galactic formations.
- **The Earth and Universe:** Connecting the cosmos with our home planet.

### Technologies Used
- HTML: Markup language for structuring the content.
- CSS: Styling to enhance the visual appeal of the website.
